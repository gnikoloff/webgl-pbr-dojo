## Place to explore theory and math behind PBR

Please not this is not production ready code, rather a playground to test the math and concepts behind PBR. In fact, these demos do not currently work on:

- Firefox, due to annoying GLSL 300 shader UBO array definition bug. You can refer to it [here](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1755973)
- Safari, due to inability to render HDR image to half floating point framebuffer. It should work, however due to my limited time on this side project and the focus being on PBR concepts, I can't bother to fix it
